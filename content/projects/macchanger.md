This program is used to securely modify the MAC Address of the desired network interface (eth0, wlan0, etc.) on Linux systems. It is a simple Python script that uses the `subprocess` module to execute the `ifconfig` command to change the MAC Address. It is a useful tool for security professionals and network administrators to change the MAC Address of the network interface to avoid being tracked.
